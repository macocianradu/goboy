# First wrote a brief overview of the first milestone of the project:
- load files form the os
- create the memory struct with read/write functions on the memory
- create a cpu state with registers 

# For the day:
- Setup goland
- Disable autocomplete on space because it doesn't work
- Find ways to store memory state in go
- Write memory module with read, write, writeall functions
- Reading or writing outside of memory bounds will close app
- Write cpu module with registers, PC, SP
- Are registers only 8bits?
- Where are instructions stored?

# Conclusion
- Can read roms from external files
- Have a 64kb memory with functions to read and write to it
- Have a cpu which reads instructions from the memory and increments the PC
